# Somnia Mini Game Engine

Lightweight game logic prototype driven by on-chain signals.

## Concept
- Core game logic runs off-chain
- Blockchain data is used as a randomness and state input
- Designed to explore fast game iteration without on-chain bottlenecks

## Scope
- Game loop
- State transitions
- Chain-derived randomness

## Notes
This is a logic prototype, not a complete game or UI.
